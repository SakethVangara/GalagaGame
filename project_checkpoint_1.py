                # DESCRIPTION OF OUR GAME #

# The game that we plan on creating, or rather recreating,
# is Galaga, a fixed shooter game where the user controls a spaceship
# and attempts to destroy the Galaga (enemy) ships. The main objective
# of the game is to defeat the Galaga forces, If the enemy hits the user,
# then the user loses a life. The game ends when the user loses all of their
# lives, so the goal is to both survive and defeat the enemy spaceships.

                # BASIC FEATURES #
# User Input: We will incorporate user input by allowing the
# user to control the keyboard, specifically the left and right arrows,
# to move their spaceship left and right across the bottom of the screen,
# respectively.

# Game Over: The user will have three lives. Every time the user
# gets hit, they will lose a life, and if they lose all three lives,
# the game is over. After the user loses all three lives, a screen
# showing the text "Game Over" will appear in the middle of the screen

# Graphics/Images: The main graphic that we will probably use
# is a starry space background, since our game takes place in space.
# We plan on implementing a different space-themed background
# for every wave (level) of the game.


            # ADDITIONAL FEATURES #
# Restart from Game Over: When the game is over
# (user runs out of lives), there will be an option for
# the user to restart the game by pressing the "Restart" button
# on the game over screen. In this way, they would not have to re-run
# the program, as the game would start up again from the beginning.

# Sprite Animation: To represent spaceship that the user controls
# and the enemy spaceships, we plan on using sprite sheets from the
# original game. In this way, we can program the gameboxes so that
# they are animated.

# Enemies: We will have multiple enemy types that the user will
# have to try and defeat. For now, we will implement two
# enemy types: Galaga (basic enemy) and Boss Galaga (main enemies).
# If time permitting, we may try to add our own twist by creating
# our own enemy types, but for now, we will stick to the aforementioned
# enemy types.

# Multiple Levels: Given the nature of the original Galaga game,
# there are multiple levels, specifically waves, that the user
# has to get through. Similarly, in our version of the game,
# we will incorporate multiple levels for the user to pass,
# each level containing a greater difficulty than the last and
# possibly different enemy types (or more enemies to defeat in general).
# For now, our plan is to make 3 to 5 waves, but if there is more time,
# we will consider adding more waves so that the game can be played longer.
